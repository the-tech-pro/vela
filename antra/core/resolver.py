"""
Multi-source resolver. Tries adapters in priority order (waterfall).
The first adapter that returns a result above the acceptance threshold wins.
Only falls through to lower-priority adapters if the current one finds nothing.

Within each priority tier, adapters are rotated on every resolve() call so the
load is distributed evenly across same-priority sources (e.g. Amazon, Apple,
HiFi all share priority 2 in the free-lossless tier). Rate-limited
adapters are moved to the back of their tier rather than skipped entirely, so
they remain available as a last resort within the tier if others also fail.
